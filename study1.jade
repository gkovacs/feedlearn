            h4 Description
            p You are invited to participate in a research study on seeing whether we can help you learn Japanese vocabulary while browsing your Facebook news stream. You will be asked to take a vocabulary pretest in Japanese. Then, you will install our Chrome extension, and use it for 3 weeks. Our extension will occasionally display vocabulary flashcards while you view your Facebook news feed. It will not access your Facebook data or post anything on your wall. After each week, you will be sent another vocabulary test to see what you have learned that week.
            h4 Time Involvement
            p  Your participation will take approximately 1.5 hours of time total, across a duration of 3 weeks.
            h4 Risks and Benefits
            p There are no foreseen risks associated with this study. The benefits are that you might learn a few new foreign-language words. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.
